Hi, I'm Jacob! I'm a software engineer interested in Distributed Systems, Site Reliability Engineering, DevOps, and Cloud. 

I have over 10 years of experience and have worked in a variety of environments such as bioinformatics, HPC, system administration, data storage, and real-time embedded systems.

I live near Ann Arbor, MI with my dog [Dorian](https://www.dorian.dog/?ref=jacobpleiness.com). If I'm not working, you can find me snowboarding, sailing, or at an EDM show.
